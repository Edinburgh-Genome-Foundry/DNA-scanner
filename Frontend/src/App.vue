<!-- This App component is the main component of this application. It is responsible for routing
between the Result and Landing component and also imports the Filter component.
The template part of this component is divided in two subparts: v-app-bar and v-content
Because we have a single page application the app-bar stays static but the content changes accordingly, which is
handled by the router.
